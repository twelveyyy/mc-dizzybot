## READ THE README.MD 

### Below is fool-proof
1. Copy these 2 files into your minecraft folder - the place with the `server.properties` file.

2. Right-click `notifyDizzy.bat` and select Edit

3. Find this line: `set "BOT_FOLDER="`

4. Change the path to the actual folder where your bot files are saved.
    
   Example: `set "BOT_FOLDER=C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\MyBot"`



Before starting the server, run `$ notifyDizzy.bat on` 

After closing the server, run `$ notifyDizzy.bat off`
